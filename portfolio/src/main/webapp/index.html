      <p>Welcome! &#128522 My name is Anika and I am currently a rising junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science with a Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Technology. 
          
          <br> I enjoy developing software applications, dabbling in product design, and building inclusive communities in tech. </br>

          <br> You can also find me doing yoga &#129336, working on random artistic projects &#128391, and eating a bunch of Trader Joe's snacks &#129379</br>
